# The Most Effective Offensive Player on the Golden State Warriors in 2016

It is easy to look at the numbers behind the five starters of the Golden State Warriors and arrive at a simplistic conclusion regarding who the most potent player on offense was. While we do not have access to information relating to the gravity of a player - the willingness of defenders and help defenders to stick to the mentioned player thus leaving teammates open, often dubbed "gravity" - we do have access to relatively detailed information regarding each of Golden State's starters that will help us analyze who the most potent offensive player is. If nothing else, we will be able to break down the offenses that each of these players can run and what they're good at on a case-by-case basis.

### Draymond Green

A veteran of 6 years, Green is without a doubt the heart and soul of this Warriors team. He consistently plays at a Defensive Player of the Year level, and the team undoubtedbly runs through him. But how good is he on offense? Breaking his shot chart down,
